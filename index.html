A family is God’s greatest gift to all living beings on earth including human beings.
 A person without family and its love is never complete and happy. A family is one with whom you can share all your joys and sorrows. Family stands by you at the toughest situations in life. Family gives you the warmth and affection that you may not get anywhere else. I too am blessed with such a family. My family has always been my strength. My mother, father, sister and I complete my family.
</p>

<h1>A mother</h1>
<p>
My mother is the strongest woman I have ever seen in my life. She is a super woman. She can manage everything at the same time so beautifully and confidently. She is a fine individual with poise and dignity. She is the pivot around whom our family revolves. She has raised us with important values in life. She explained to us the true essence of love and compassion. She also tells us the importance of spirituality. She has given utmost importance to our education. She coordinates with our teachers in school and helps us with our weaknesses. My mother is an amazing cook and takes care of what we like to eat. She’s  just not a housewife. She is an entrepreneur too. She owns a restaurant managing a staff of 30 boys. It is indeed not an easy job but she manages everything very efficiently. She is an inspiration to all of us. She is indispensable to our family.

<h1>A father </h1>
<p>
My father is a man of strong principles. His presence at home itself gives us a sense of security and hope. He is very gentle, disciplined and strict. He is a software engineer by qualification and works for a multinational company. Since the headquarters of his company is in The United States of America, he frequently needs to travel. I know he feels very sorry that he is not able to spend much time with us due to work pressure and travel but whenever he is at home he makes the best of it. He has a good sense of humor. He makes us laugh with his jokes and keeps telling us about his work experience. I get a lot of insight from it and clarity of what field I can take when I grow up. I have learnt a most important and valuable lesson from him that is being content in life with whatever I have. The atmosphere in our home becomes so cheerful and joyful when he is around. It gives a feeling of a complete family. He is a dutiful son towards his mother.

<h1>A big brother </h1>
<p>
Eldest My family has the best connection and the weirdest at the same time. My family isn’t considered as a big family according to Arab families. My father and my mother are the best parents I have ever seen. I am the eldest brother in my family. I have more than one role to play in my beloved family. My younger brother is the hiper one who loves hanging out with his friends. He is mostly my biggest responsibility. Finally, my little two sisters. They are the most adorable thing in the whole world. The role that am playing in my family is pretty solid but with some complications. When someone wants to take a new step in life we ask for each other opinion. Usually the younger goes to the elder to asking for an advice. Even me as the eldest 
I alresponsibilities towards my brother. Friends are the most effective element, it could drown a person in the deep dark ocean, or sometimes good friends leads to the top of glorious. Girls are usually the cutest thing in the house. “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit, a golden thread the meaning of life.” - Isadora James. So my responsibility towards them is to treat them as princesses. Try as much as I can to avoid any problem that they might face. If they face a problem, I become their strong back to face anything without fear. The complicated part of all this that I am doing 
ways thank God for the family that am part of. I love taking care of them. It is not an easy thing to do, but I love being their big brother. Sometimes I take care of my mother and father, even though they are not very old. My mother loves talking to me so much, complaining about her work or problem she’s facing. It is blessing seeing my mother comfortably talking with me and complaining without constraint. My brother is the one who is causing the problems to me. He is an outgoing person. Now he grew up a little bit, so he is doing better now. But he is still not fully grown up. I have to look after him every now and then, I am always looking forward to meet his friends and know them. In my opinion, meeting his friends is number one on the list of my
